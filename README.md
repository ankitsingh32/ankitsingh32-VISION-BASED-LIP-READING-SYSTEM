# ankitsingh32-VISION-BASED-LIP-READING-SYSTEM
Vision-Based Lip Reading System Using NLP
A deep learning-based system that interprets spoken words from silent video frames by analyzing lip movements. This project integrates computer vision and natural language processing (NLP) to build a lip-reading model capable of transcribing video-based speech inputs into meaningful text.

🧠 Project Overview
Lip reading has significant applications in security, silent communication, and aiding individuals with speech or hearing impairments. This project focuses on building an automated system that:

Detects and localizes lip movements from video frames.

Extracts visual features using CNNs or 3D-CNNs.

Translates these visual cues into text using NLP models like RNNs, LSTMs, or Transformers.

🔧 Features
Lip region detection using facial landmarks.

Frame preprocessing (grayscale, normalization, cropping).

Temporal feature extraction from video sequences.

Sequence-to-sequence NLP model for text generation.

Real-time or batch video inference.

🛠️ Technologies Used
Python

OpenCV – For video processing and face/lip detection

Dlib / Mediapipe – Facial landmark detection

TensorFlow / PyTorch – Deep learning framework

CNN, LSTM, Transformer – For feature extraction and sequence modeling

NLTK / spaCy – For optional text postprocessing or augmentation

Streamlit / Flask – (Optional) For demo UI
